# gifTastic

App is created using GIPHY API data

Theme is nature 

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. 

If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, the rating is displayed(PG, G, so on).

There is a user input box that adds buttons on the page.
